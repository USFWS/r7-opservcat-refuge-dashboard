# R7 (Alaska) GitHub Repository Template

## Overview

The **r7-repo-template** is a [GitHub repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for USFWS Region 7 (Alaska) projects. The template is used to create a repository containing metadata files that meet [DOI GitHub Enterprise Cloud (DGEC) development guidance](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/ocio-DOI-GitHub-Enterprise/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior%2FDGEC%20Development%20Guidance%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior) requirements. These metadata files should be customized to the specific repository by following the instructions under [Customize metadata files](#update-metadata-files) below.

## Installation

No installation is necessary. Follow the instructions under [Usage](#usage) below to create a repository using this template.

## Usage

According to the DGEC Rules of Behavior, **you must hold a [Maintain Role](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/ocio-DOI-GitHub-Enterprise/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior%2FDGEC%20Rules%20of%20Behavior%20%2D%20Maintain%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior) to create repositories within the DGEC.** There are two ways to create a new repository using this template. If you have a DGEC Maintain Role, you can follow either of the options below.

### Create a new repository

#### Option 1. Create a new repository from the FWS GitHub organization home page

1.  From the home page of the FWS GitHub organization, select the [Repositories tab](https://github.com/orgs/USFWS/repositories).
2.  Select the **New repository** green button.
3.  Under Repository template, select **USFWS/r7-repo-template**. Leave **Include all branches** unchecked.
4.  Give your new repository a name. A repository name should be descriptive, readable, consistent, contextual, and brief. For repositories that are not R packages, the best practice is to name repositories using lower case alphanumeric characters separated by a dash (-) rather than spaces or underscores. R package names must only consist or letters, numbers, and periods. They must start with a letter and can not end with a period. For other things to consider, refer to Hadley Wickham's [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html#name-your-package) book. 
5.  Select the [repository visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) (i.e., Public, Internal, or Private). See **2.1 Repository Classification** in the [DOI DGEC Development Guidance document](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/ocio-DOI-GitHub-Enterprise/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior%2FDGEC%20Development%20Guidance%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior) for information on an appropriate level of visibility for your repository.
6.  Select **Create repository from template**.

#### Option 2. Create a new repository from the r7-repo-template repository

1.  Navigate to the [r7-repo-template repository](https://github.com/USFWS/r7_DGEC_template).
2.  Select the **Use this template** green button.
3.  Choose "Create a new repository" from the drop down menu.
4.  Give your new repository a name. A repository name should be descriptive, readable, consistent, contextual, and brief. For repositories that are not R packages, the best practice is to name repositories using lower case alphanumeric characters separated by a dash (-) rather than spaces or underscores. R package names must only consist or letters, numbers, and periods. They must start with a letter and can not end with a period. For other things to consider, refer to Hadley Wickham's [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/workflow101.html#name-your-package) book. 
5.  Select the [repository visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) (i.e., Public, Internal, or Private). See **2.1 Repository Classification** in the [DOI DGEC Development Guidance document](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/ocio-DOI-GitHub-Enterprise/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior%2FDGEC%20Development%20Guidance%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior) for information on an appropriate level of visibility for your repository.
6.  Select **Create repository from template**.

### Update metadata files

The **r7-repo-template** contains metadata files that are required under the [DOI DGEC Development Guidance document](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/ocio-DOI-GitHub-Enterprise/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior%2FDGEC%20Development%20Guidance%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Focio%2DDOI%2DGitHub%2DEnterprise%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FRules%20of%20Behavior). The files described in the table below should be updated when creating a repository from this template.
